# Chapter 02 - Vectors
Vectors are one of the most fundamental data structures in R. They are used to store sequences of elements of the same type. Hereâ€™s an overview of vectors and some common operations performed on them.

## Basic Operations
### Creating Vectors
Vectors can be created using the c() function, which combines elements into a vector.

```R
# Numeric vector
num_vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Character vector
char_vec <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# Logical vector
log_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```
### Accessing Elements
You can access elements of a vector using square brackets [].

```R
# Access the second element
num_vec[2]  # Output: 2

# Access multiple elements
num_vec[c(1, 3, 5)]  # Output: 1 3 5
```
### Modifying Vectors
You can modify elements of a vector by assigning new values.

```R
# Change the third element
num_vec[3] <- 10

# Append elements to a vector
num_vec <- c(num_vec, 6, 7)
```

## Vector Operations
### Arithmetic Operations
Arithmetic operations on vectors are performed element-wise.

```R
# Addition
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c(4, 5, 6)
c <- a + b  # Output: 5 7 9

# Multiplication
d <- a * b  # Output: 4 10 18
```
### Mathematical Functions
R provides many built-in functions to operate on vectors.

```R
# Sum of elements
sum(num_vec)  # Output: sum of elements in num_vec

# Mean of elements
mean(num_vec)  # Output: mean of elements in num_vec

# Maximum and Minimum
max(num_vec)  # Output: maximum element in num_vec
min(num_vec)  # Output: minimum element in num_vec
```
### Logical Operations
Logical operations on vectors are also element-wise.

```R
# Comparison
e <- a > 2  # Output: FALSE FALSE TRUE

# Logical AND
f <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
g <- c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
h <- f & g  # Output: FALSE FALSE TRUE
```
### Subsetting Vectors
You can subset vectors using logical conditions.

```R
# Subset elements greater than 3
subset_vec <- num_vec[num_vec > 3]  # Output: elements of num_vec greater than 3
```
## Vector Functions

### length()
Get the number of elements in a vector.

```R
length(num_vec)  # Output: length of num_vec
```
### sort()
Sort the elements of a vector.

```R
sorted_vec <- sort(num_vec)  # Output: sorted elements of num_vec
```
### unique()
Get the unique elements of a vector.

```R
unique_vec <- unique(c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4))  # Output: 1 2 3 4
```
### Combining Vectors
You can combine multiple vectors using the c() function.

```R
# Combine two vectors
combined_vec <- c(a, b)  # Output: combined elements of a and b
```
### Replicating Vectors
You can replicate elements of a vector using the rep() function.

```R
# Replicate elements of a vector
rep_vec <- rep(c(1, 2, 3), times = 2)  # Output: 1 2 3 1 2 3
rep_vec_each <- rep(c(1, 2, 3), each = 2)  # Output: 1 1 2 2 3 3
```
#### Understanding vectors and their operations is crucial for effective data manipulation and analysis in R, as they form the basis of more complex data structures like matrices and data frames.

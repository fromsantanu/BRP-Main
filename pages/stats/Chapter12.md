# Chapter: Resampling Techniques

## Overview

Resampling techniques are essential tools in statistics and machine learning. They are used to assess the variability of statistical estimates and to improve the robustness of predictive models. Two common resampling techniques are Bootstrap methods and Cross-validation. In this chapter, we will cover Bootstrap methods using the `boot()` function and Cross-validation using the `cv.glm()` function in R.

## 1. Bootstrap Methods

### `boot()`

Bootstrap methods involve repeatedly sampling with replacement from the data to estimate the distribution of a statistic. This technique is particularly useful for estimating confidence intervals and assessing the stability of a model.

#### Example: Bootstrap Estimate of the Mean

```r
# Ensure the 'boot' package is installed
if(!require(boot)) install.packages("boot")

library(boot)

# Example data: A simple numeric vector
set.seed(123)
data <- rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 10)

# Function to compute the statistic of interest (e.g., mean)
bootstrap_mean <- function(data, indices) {
  return(mean(data[indices]))
}

# Applying the bootstrap method
bootstrap_result <- boot(data = data, statistic = bootstrap_mean, R = 1000)

# Viewing the bootstrap results
print(bootstrap_result)

# Plotting the bootstrap distribution
plot(bootstrap_result, main = "Bootstrap Distribution of the Mean")
```

### Interpreting Bootstrap Results

- **Original**: The statistic computed from the original data.
- **Bias**: The difference between the average of the bootstrap estimates and the original statistic.
- **Standard Error**: The standard deviation of the bootstrap estimates, providing a measure of the variability of the statistic.

### Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

You can compute confidence intervals for the statistic using the bootstrap results.

```r
# Bootstrap confidence intervals
bootstrap_ci <- boot.ci(bootstrap_result, type = "basic")
print(bootstrap_ci)
```

### Different Types of Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

The `boot.ci()` function provides several types of confidence intervals, including:

- **Basic**: A simple method based on the bootstrap distribution.
- **Percentile**: Based on the percentiles of the bootstrap distribution.
- **BCa**: Bias-corrected and accelerated interval, which adjusts for bias and skewness in the bootstrap distribution.

## 2. Cross-Validation

### `cv.glm()`

Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the predictive performance of a model by splitting the data into training and testing sets. The `cv.glm()` function from the `boot` package is used to perform k-fold cross-validation for generalized linear models (GLMs).

#### Example: k-Fold Cross-Validation for a Logistic Regression Model

```r
# Example data: Simulated binary outcome and predictor
set.seed(123)
predictor <- rnorm(100)
outcome <- rbinom(100, 1, prob = 1 / (1 + exp(-predictor)))

# Creating a data frame
data <- data.frame(predictor, outcome)

# Fitting a logistic regression model
glm_model <- glm(outcome ~ predictor, data = data, family = binomial)

# Performing k-fold cross-validation (e.g., 10-fold)
cv_result <- cv.glm(data, glm_model, K = 10)

# Viewing the cross-validation results
print(cv_result$delta)
```

### Interpreting Cross-Validation Results

- **delta**: A vector of two elements: the raw cross-validation estimate of prediction error and the adjusted cross-validation estimate. The adjustment compensates for the fact that the same data point is used multiple times in cross-validation.

### Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)

Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) is a special case of k-fold cross-validation where k equals the number of observations. It is useful for small datasets.

```r
# Performing Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation
loocv_result <- cv.glm(data, glm_model, K = nrow(data))

# Viewing the LOOCV results
print(loocv_result$delta)
```

## Summary

- **Bootstrap Methods**: Used to assess the variability of a statistic by resampling the data with replacement. The `boot()` function is central to performing bootstrap analysis in R.
- **Cross-Validation**: Used to evaluate the predictive performance of a model by partitioning the data into training and testing sets. The `cv.glm()` function facilitates cross-validation for generalized linear models.
